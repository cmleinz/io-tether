# io-tether

Traits for defining I/O objects which will automatically reconnect upon failure.

This project is similar in scope to [stubborn-io](https://github.com/craftytrickster/stubborn-io),
but aims to leverage the recently stabilized `async fn` in traits, to make the
implementation of reconnecting simpler for the end user.

## State

This project is still very much a work in progress, I intend on adding more to 
it in the coming days.
